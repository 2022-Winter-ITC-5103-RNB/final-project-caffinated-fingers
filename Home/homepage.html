          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is Crypto Currency?</a>
        
            <p>Cryptocurrency is an internet-based medium of exchange which uses cryptographical functions to conduct financial transactions. 
              Cryptocurrencies leverage blockchain technology to gain decentralization, transparency, and immutability.</p>
          
        </li>
  
        <li>
          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Crypto Currency and Blockchain?</a>
          
            <p>The transaction is known almost immediately by the whole network. But only after a specific amount of time it gets confirmed.
              Confirmation is a critical concept in cryptocurrencies. You could say that cryptocurrencies are all about confirmation.
              As long as a transaction is unconfirmed, it is pending and can be forged. When a transaction is confirmed, it is set in stone. It is no longer forgeable, it can‘t be reversed, it is part of an immutable record of historical transactions: of the so-called blockchain.</p>

          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Disposing of cryptocurrencies?</a>
          
            <p>In general, possessing or holding a cryptocurrency is not taxable. However, there may be tax implications when you dispose of your cryptocurrency. Examples of this could include:

              selling or trading it
              giving it as a gift
              converting it to government-issued currency, such as Canadian dollars
              using it to buy goods or services</p>

          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Types of cryptocurrencies?</a>
          
            <p>Bitcoin was the first of the many cryptocurrencies that exist today. Following its introduction in 2009, developers began to create other variants of cryptocurrencies based on the technology powering the Bitcoin network. In most cases, the cryptocurrencies were designed to improve upon the standards set by Bitcoin. That is why other cryptocurrencies that came after bitcoin are collectively called “altcoins” from the phrase “alternatives to bitcoin.” Prominent examples are:<br>
              -Ethereum<br>
              -Litecoin<br>
              -Cardano<br>
              -XRP<br>
              -Polkadot<br>
              -EOS<br>
              -Solana<br>
              -Bitcoin Cash<br>

        <li>
          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is Bitcoin?</a>
          
            <p>Bitcoin is the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency. It enables peer-to-peer exchange of value in the digital realm through the use of a decentralized protocol, 
              cryptography, and a mechanism to achieve global consensus on the state of a periodically updated public transaction ledger called a 'blockchain.'</p>
              Bitcoin is a form of digital money that :<br>
              (1) exists independently of any government, state, or financial institution, <br>
              (2) can be transferred globally without the need for a centralized intermediary, and <br>
              (3) has a known monetary policy that arguably cannot be altered.<br>
        </li>
  
        <li>
          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is Bitcoin used for?</a>
          
            <p>At its most basic level, Bitcoin is useful for transacting value outside of the traditional financial system. People use Bitcoin to, for example, make international payments that are settled faster, more securely, 
              and at lower transactional fees than through legacy settlement methods such as the SWIFT or ACH networks.</p>
              Another popular narrative is that Bitcoin supports economic freedom. It is said to do this by providing, on an opt-in basis, an alternative form of money that integrates strong protection against <br>
              (1) monetary confiscation, <br>
              (2) censorship, and <br>
              (3) devaluation through uncapped inflation. Note that this narrative is not mutually exclusive from the 'digital gold' narrative.
        </li>
  
        <li>
          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who decides what Bitcoin is?</a>
          
            <p>Bitcoin is not a static protocol. It can and has integrated changes throughout its lifetime, and it will continue to evolve. While there are a number of formalized procedures for upgrading Bitcoin (see "How does Bitcoin governance work?"), 
              governance of the protocol is ultimately based on deliberation, persuasion, and volition. In other words, people decide what Bitcoin is.</p>

          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Crypto Exchanges?</a>
          
            <p>Cryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, 
              such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies</p>
          
        </li>
  
        <li>
          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Atomic swaps?</a>
         
            <p>Atomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency, 
              without the need for a trusted third party such as an exchange.</p>
          
        </li>
  
        <li>
          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Price trends?</a>
          
            <p>The "market cap" of any coin is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation. 
              The total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by Bitcoin accounting for at least 50% of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's value is largely determined by speculation among other technological limiting factors known as block chain rewards coded into the architecture technology of Bitcoin itself. The cryptocurrency market cap follows a trend known as the "halving", which is when the block rewards received from Bitcoin are halved due to technological mandated limited factors instilled into Bitcoin which in turn limits the supply of Bitcoin. As the date reaches near of an halving (twice thus far historically) 
              the cryptocurrency market cap increases, followed by a downtrend.</p>

          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Good Reasons to Invest in Cryptocurrency?</a>
          
            <p>-You believe that cryptocurrencies are the way of the future and will likely replace the traditional fiat money  if this happens, you want to be educated, prepared, and experienced.<br>
              -You support the social vision behind cryptocurrencies — that currency should be decentralized and under full control of the people who use it.<br>
              -You understand and appreciate how blockchain technology works — you value the peer-to-peer aspect of transactions, their security, and confidentiality.<br>
            </p>
          
        </li>
  
        <li>
          <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is Cryptocurrency a Good Investment?</a>
          
            <p>Cryptocurrency prices can be extremely volatile and impossible to predict in the short term. All it takes is an announcement from a large company or a tweet from Elon Musk, 
              and the currency’s value can skyrocket or plummet in a matter of hours.
              Before investing in cryptocurrencies, it’s absolutely imperative that you educate yourself so you can be equipped to make the right decision at the right time. Or as they say: DYOR – do your own research!

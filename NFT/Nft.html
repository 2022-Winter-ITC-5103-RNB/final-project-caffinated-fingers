            <h3><p>What is NFT?</p></h3><br>
            <p>An NFT is a unit of data, stored on a type of digital ledger called a blockchain, which can be sold and traded. 
                The NFT can be associated with a particular digital or physical asset (such as a file or a physical object) and a license to
                use the asset for a specified purpose. An NFT (and, if applicable, the associated license to use, copy, or display the 
                underlying asset) can be traded and sold on digital markets. The extralegal nature of NFT trading usually results in an 
                informal exchange of ownership over the asset that has no legal basis for enforcement, and so often confers little more than 
                use as a status symbol.<br><br>

                NFTs function like cryptographic tokens, but unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs are not mutually 
                interchangeable, and so are not fungible. (While all bitcoins are equal, each NFT may represent a different underlying asset 
                and thus may have a different value.) NFTs are created when blockchains concatenate records containing cryptographic 
                hashes—sets of characters that identify a set of data—onto previous records, creating a chain of identifiable data blocks. 
                This cryptographic transaction process ensures the authentication of each digital file[clarification needed] by providing a 
                digital signature that tracks NFT ownership. Data links that are part of NFT records, that for example may point to details 
                about where the associated art is stored, can be affected by link rot.</p><br>

            <h3><p>NFT trading platforms</p></h3><br>
            <p>1. OpenSea<br>
                OpenSea is the leader in NFT sales. OpenSea has all sorts of digital assets available on its platform, and it's free to sign up 
                and browse the extensive offerings. It also supports artists and creators and has an easy-to-use process if you want to create 
                your own NFT (known as "minting").<br>
                
                The marketplace supports more than 150 different payment tokens, so the platform's name is appropriate. For an introduction to 
                the NFT world, OpenSea is a great place to start.<br><br>
            
                2. Rarible<br>
                Rarible is another large marketplace for all sorts of NFTs, similar to OpenSea. All kinds of art, videos, collectibles, and music 
                can be bought, sold, or created on the platform. However, unlike OpenSea, you'll need to use the marketplace's own token Rarible 
                (CRYPTO:RARI) to buy and sell on the marketplace. Rarible is built on the Ethereum blockchain (although artwork can be managed on 
                OpenSea as well using Rarible tokens).

                The company has partnered with some notable companies. Yum! Brands' (NYSE:YUM) Taco Bell has listed art on Rarible, and cloud 
                software giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently partnered with Rarible to help secure NFT artists' and creators' work.<br><br>

                3. Larva Labs/CryptoPunks<br>
                Larva Labs is best known for the viral CryptoPunks NFTproject. They were originally given away for free back in 2017, but some 
                CryptoPunks have sold for millions of dollars since then. Larva Labs has other digital art projects going such as Autoglyphs, as 
                well as other Ethereum blockchain-based app development projects.<br>

                Larva Labs' CryptoPunks NFTs are sold out, but they can be bid on and bought from various third-party marketplaces. Nevertheless, 
                Larva Labs' various projects are worth keeping tabs on, including the Meebits, which can be bid on directly from the company's 
                built-in marketplace.

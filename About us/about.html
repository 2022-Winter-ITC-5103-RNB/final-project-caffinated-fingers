    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        
    <p>We provide a platform where people with no knowledge of cryptocurrency <br>
           can find useful information, tools, and techniques to help them learn <br>
           about various types of cryptocurrencies<br>
           They can use this information to invest in the cryptocurrency world more efficiently.<br>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
    
    <p>
        <h4>Cryptocurrency Is Owned By Everyone</h4>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrency works in a similar way to traditional national currencies, but with a few key distinctions.<br>
            A political entity creates and regulates current "fiat currencies," all of which presently represent debt. <br>
            Anyone who owns a country's currency is in possession of a "IOU" issued by that country.<br>
            The term "cryptocurrency" does not mean "debt." It just represents itself, and its worth is decided by what <br>
            someone is prepared to give up in exchange for it.<br>
            The decentralised nature of bitcoin has a significant impact on how its value is determined.<br>
            A cryptocurrency is neither owned nor regulated by anyone. Its value is unaffected by the political whims of<br>
             a country's government or the monetary policies of its central bank.
        </p>
        <h4>Transactions with cryptocurrency are (mostly) private.</h4>
        <p>
            With traditional currencies issued by governments, you can privately transact or pay for something in person using<br>
            physical cash.<br>
            Paper, metal, cloth, and plastic currencies account for a small percentage of total fiat money in circulation. Large<br>
            cash withdrawals are promptly detected and investigated by a central authority, such as governments and banking system authorities.<br>
            Cryptocurrency is a unique concept. To track the exchange between two persons or firms, well-designed math is required. This is mostly <br>
            done behind people's backs. While the ledger or list of transactions may be viewed by anybody in the world, the people who exchange<br>
             cryptocurrencies are more private. Cryptocurrencies are held electronically in digital wallets by definition. The owner is the owner <br>
             of the wallet's private key. The currency is usually exchanged digitally from users' anonymous wallets.<br>

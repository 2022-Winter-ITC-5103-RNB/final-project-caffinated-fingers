            <h1 class="ml1">BITCOIN</h1>


            <p class="ml2">Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks;
                managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.
                Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take
                part.
                Through many of its unique properties,
                Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.</p>

            <h1 class="ml3">ETHERUM</h1>
            <p class="ml4">Ethereum, which launched in 2015, is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after
                Bitcoin.
                But unlike Bitcoin, it wasn’t created to be digital money.
                Instead, Ethereum’s founders set out to build a new kind of global, decentralized computing
                platform that takes the security and openness of blockchains and extends those attributes
                to a vast range of applications.
                Everything from financial tools and games to complex databases are already running on the Ethereum
                blockchain. And its future potential is only limited by developers’ imaginations.
                As the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation puts it: “Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize,
                secure and trade just about anything.”</p>

            <h1 class="ml5">POLKA DOT</h1>
            <p class="ml6"> Polkadot is an open source, blockchain platform and cryptocurrency that allows for
                distributed computing.
                The network uses a proof of stake consensus algorithm.[2] The protocol used,
                Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension (BABE), is derived from Ouroboros.
                The protocol was adapted by the Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood and is developed by the Web3 Foundation
                with the initial implementation by Parity Technologies.
                In June 2021, Coinbase added Polkadot to its cryptocurrency trading platform.</p>

            <h1 class="ml7">DOGE COIN</h1>
            <p class="ml8">Is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer,
                who decided to create a payment system as a "joke",
                making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time.
                It is considered both the first "meme coin", and, more specifically,
                the first "dog coin". Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate investment
                prospect. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" meme as its logo and namesake.
